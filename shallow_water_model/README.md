This folder contains a Jupyter notebook to run a shallow water model with pre-defined experiments, as well as some supplemental files.

This python notebook solves the non-linear shallow water equations on a Cartesian beta plane in a channel, with several different options for model set-up to illustrate a range of meteorological phenomenona.

The code and experiment set was originally programed in MATLAB by Robin Hogan and translated to python by Paul Connolly. It was hacked roughly into notebook form by Matt Barlow, with a few additional features added, ignoring all principles of robust coding. If you have any questions, find any bugs, or develop any improvements please email Mathew_Barlow@uml.edu.  

A separate pdf file, swe_notes.pdf, further describes the different intial conditions and configurations, and two additional data files, digitial_elevation_map.mat and reanalysis.mat, are also included.
